Simple scripts will make life easier for you and your tasks. If they were useful to you please leave your feedback. 

I will briefly describe the scripts:
1. "clear data Telegram.bat" - finds the folder with Telegram data and clears it.
2. "clear_dolphin.bat" - finds the folder with Dolphin data and clears them. Very helpful if you have a bad update.
3. "fix_audio_5_sek.bat" - rarely but happens that WAudio(WindowsAudio) service gets tired, this script helps solve. Attention! It will also re-login the user.
4. "install Telegram & Signal.bat" - This script downloads the latest versions of the programs, installs them silently and cleans up after itself.
5. "install sip.bat" - installs the latest stable version of the popular SIP Phone - "MicroSIP", after installation it clears all traces.
6. "ntp fix.bat" - quick and easy edits for the region, you can change to any of your inside.
